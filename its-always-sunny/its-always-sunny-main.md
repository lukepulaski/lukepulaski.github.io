# A Very Sunny Overanalysis: The ingredients of a great episode of *It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia*

## Content Warning
This project will center around the show *Itâ€™s Always Sunny in Philadelphia*, which frequently depicts or discusses:
-	Substance abuse
-	Violence and death
-	Sexual content
-	Offensive language and behavior
-	Psychopathy and antisocial behavior<br>

Some of these themes will be central to the subsequent analysis. While I personally find many of these scenes and episodes to be
humorous, I do not condone these actions and behaviors themselves. The purpose of this exercise will ultimately be to measure
whether the inclusion of certain themes and characters in episodes correlates with higher audience approval or greater personal
enjoyment.

## Summary
As I write this August of 2025, the creators of [*It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It's_Always_Sunny_in_Philadelphia) 
(IASIP) are currently rolling out the 17th (*17th!*) season of what I consider to be one of the funniest TV comedies of all time and almost
certainly one of the best ongoing comedy series. Reveling in yet another 8 episodes of Mac, Charlie, Dennis, Dee, and Frank's tomfoolery 
and borderline felonies has begun to make me wonder what exactly it is that I love so much about tuning into watch this merry band of 
scumbags week after week. 

In this study, I aim to analyze all episodes of the previous 16 seasons of IASIP to see which topics, themes, and characters correlate with the highest 
audience ratings. These characteristics might include how much screen time/dialogue each main character gets, whether certain well-known side characters 
make an appearance, if an episode tries to make social commentary, etc. Before looking at any audience ratings, I will also rate each episode based on how
much I remember enjoying it to see if there are any commonalities between what I love about IASIP and what the broader audience seems to enjoy.

Having aired its pilot episode in 2005, IASIP has been torturing the airwaves with perhaps the most toxic cast of characters in modern sitcom history for 
nearly the literal duration of my lifetime. I can think of no better way to pay homage to it than to distill it down to a few tables, graphs, and charts, 
and put it under a microscope on 400,000x magnification. 

Spoiler alert: I have rated the episodes and I think that "The Gang Gives Frank an Intervention" is the best. If you would like to voice your displeasure
