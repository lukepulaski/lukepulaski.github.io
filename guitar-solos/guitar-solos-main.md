# Creating the statistically perfect guitar solo

## Summary
I started playing guitar a little less than two years ago. During that time, I've spent hours strumming chords, 
reading tabs for pretty much every song on my Spotify recommended playlist, and endlessly cycling through the 
[minor pentatonic box](https://www.pickupmusic.com/blog/how-to-play-minor-pentatonic-scales). However, after 
spending so much time learning the fundamentals of the instrument, I would love nothing more than to construct an 
original composition on the guitar.

The guitar solo is arguably one of the most divisive art forms of our modern age. Your uncle at a family barbecue 
will swear that the complex solos of the likes of [Jimmy Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Page) and [Eric Clapton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Clapton)
are the pinnacle of music and everything released since then is derivative garbage, while anyone too young to remember 
a time when George W. Bush was in the Oval Office will probably have gotten way too obsessed with the angry, simplisitc 
grunge  solos of the '90s at one point or another. [Pink Floyd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Floyd) fans opt for solos mostly consisting of empty space, while [Metallica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallica) lovers 
(I will put myself in this category) prefer solos that sound like how I imagine riding a skateboard at terminal velocity 
over a gravel road feels. 

The greatest guitarists of generations past have intricately crafted melodic and emotionally moving guitar solos that 
have stood the test of time. I want to do that, but writing a solo so perfect that is still played and listened to all 
over the world requires things like creativity, coordination, and muscial ability, all of which I have none.

So, instead of practicing more to develop my own musical voice, I will look for trends in the qualities that the greatest 
guitar solos of all time tend to share (genre, musical key, duration, distortion, tempo, etc.) to come up with the 
qualities of *the* perfect guitar solo.

Will I learn anything from exercise? Probably not. Will this make me a better guitar player? Certainly not; it would take 
time away from me actually playing the guitar. 

I really hope this unlocks the secrets of mastering the guitar, because months of on-and-off practicing definitely hasn't.
