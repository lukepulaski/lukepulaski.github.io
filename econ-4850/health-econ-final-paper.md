# University of Vermont (UVM) Health Economics (ECON 4850) Final Paper

This project, completed at the end of the fall 2024 semester, was submitted as a term
paper for my Health Economics course with Professor Erkmen Aslim. I would say that class, 
and this paper by extension, was one of my most memorable courses I took at UVM. I credit it 
with developing my ongoing interest in immersing myself in the fields of health economics, 
behaviorial economics, and health policy. I enjoyed the process for this paper quite a bit, 
and even though it was frustrating that there was an 8-page limit for the final product 
(if I recall correctly), it was a great exercise in writing concisely.

The main question this paper seeks to answer is if there is [adverse selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_selection) into voluntary 
Medicare programs. Basically, using a repeated cross-section of Medicare enrollees from 2019 to 2023, 
I was looking for a pattern of unhealthier (or "riskier") individuals to enroll at higher rates. While 
takeup rates for programs like Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D are quite high, I still 
got some particularly salient results. If you are interested, please download a PDF of my paper to 
give it a read! I've included my Stata code and cleaned dataset below as well.
