        <h2 class="section-header"> Overview </h2>
        <p class="content-text">
          Throughout the Spring semester of 2025, I was fortunate enough to work a paid position as an Undergradute Research Assistant under Professor Erkmen Aslim of the University of Vermont Department of Economics. In conjunction with a team from the Department of Geography and Geosciences at UVM, we conducted the preliminary research to undertake a project to uncover the potential ramifications of adding a new race category to the 2030 United States Census. The ultimate goal of this study will be to investigate how this new race category might impact future federal funding patterns and congressional redistricting efforts.
        </p>

      <section class="section">
        <h2 class="section-header"> Policy Background </h2>
        <p class="content-text">
          In 2024, the Biden administration moved forward with proposals to distinguish "Middle Eastern/North African", or MENA, as a new race category for the 2030 Census. Prior to this change, most individuals belonging to Middle Eastern or North African ethnic groups, when prompted for their race/ethnicity on Census forms, would have been directed to select the <a href="https://www.census.gov/topics/population/race/about.html" target="_blank">"White"</a> category (which included anyone with "origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa"). So, barring any sudden halt to the rollout of this new decree, persons identifying with groups including, but not limited to, Egyptian, Lebanese, Moroccan, Iraqi, Iranian, Kurdish, Syrian, or Palestinian will now be able to more accurately express their racial identity on federal data collection forms.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2 class="section-header"> Why This Matters </h2>
        <p class="content-text">
          Introducting the MENA category would represent a small step toward making MENA communities feel completely heard and valued by the federal government. It additionally provides a very exciting new area of study for economists, sociologists, and public policy analysts. In previous censes, the federal government lumped European-Americans and MENA-Americans into one racial group, despite the fact that they may have vastly different socioeconomic qualities. On average, White (European-American) and MENA communities might experience vastly different outcomes with regards to education and health, as well as access to public assistance programs like [SNAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supplemental_Nutrition_Assistance_Program). Being able to more precisely define individuals as identifying as White versus MENA will certainly lend valuable insights into whether any of these smaller communities might be struggling and in greater need of help from the federal government.
        </p>
        <p class="content-text">
          Census data is a frequently-used tool by US Representatives to determine where to allocate the millions, and sometimes hundreds of millions, of dollars they are each able to secure for their districts. If new Census data demonstrates that a certain district has a large MENA population, and that district is struggling economically, has disproportionately  worse health outcomes, or has a disproportionately low takeup rate for social programs, this could result in an increased proportion of federal funding flowing into institutions  such as hospitals or Social Security and SNAP offices for the benefit of MENA communities.
        </p>
        <p class="content-text">
          Knowing exactly where high concentrations of MENA individuals are located could also affect the process of congressional redistricting further down the line. When it comes to redistricting with regards to MENA communities, there are two main concerns (as there are with any disadvantaged groups of voters): "packing" and "cracking". 
        </p>

        <p class="content-text">
          "Packing" is the practice of concentrating as many members of a voting bloc into as few districts as possible, allowing members of another voting bloc to have more political power in other districts. When it comes to the proper representation of MENA individuals at the congressional district level, packing MENA individuals into a few districts can actually carry some benefits. If a state has a large enclave of MENA individuals, as is the case in our example state, grouping as many of those communities as possible into a single district would allow for MENA voters in that district to elect a  representative that will better represent their own interests. This redistricting strategy could be particularly beneficial for the MENA population in a state like Michigan, where the vast majority the  state's MENA population lives enclaves within Metro Detroit. That said, this packing strategy might greatly dilute the political power of MENA individuals living outside those main enclaves.
        </p>
        <p class="content-text">
          "Cracking" is the practice of splitting members of a voting bloc into multiple districts so that members' political influence in each of the new districts is too diluted to be effective. To use Michigan and Metro Detroit as an example again, redistricting might take place in such a way as to divide the large enclaves of MENA individuals across 4 or 5 districts to make it so that an insignificant proportion of voters in each district are MENA, making it so that their voices are very unlikely to be heard at the district level.
        </p>
        <p class="content-text">
          What does all of this mean in the context of this project? Keeping in mind that cracking and packing are common redistricting strategies often used to silence (though sometimes to strengthen, in some cases of packing) voters from disadvantaged groups, we will looking to identify areas with high MENA concentration that are at risk of being redistricted in the wake of the 2030 Census. We would like to get an idea of which MENA-concentrated areas are likely to be "cracked" into non-MENA concentrated districts and which might be "packed" in with other highly MENA-concentrated areas. However, identifying the at-risk districts isn't just a matter of geography; socioeconomics comes into play as well. 
        </p>
        <p class="content-text">
          If the MENA population and non-MENA population in a certain area have similar outcomes with regard to metrics like income, health, or usage of public assistance, then perhaps redistricting doesn't pose that much of a threat to the political power of those MENA enclaves. However, if those socioeconomic outcomes are vastly different across those two subsets of the population, redistricting could potentially have very beneficial or very harmful effects on those same MENA enclaves. This is where my work, under the supervision and direction of Professor Aslim, becomes important.
