# University of Vermont (UVM) CS 021 Final Project

Having completed this in the fall semester of 2022 (my sophomore year), I would guess that this 
is the first large-scale coding project I've ever finished. Prior to taking CS 021, I had taken 
a half-year elective in computer programming as a senior in high school, but only learned the 
basic Python syntax and functions during that time. Given my inexperience at the time, it would 
make sense that this program, while completely functional, is quite crude.

The prompt for the final project was fairly open-ended: as I remember it, the main requirement was 
to construct a playable game (either a rendition of an existing game or a game of our own invention) 
that had a reasonable level of complexity. I chose to build a program that allows the user to play the 
well-known game show Deal or No Deal in the Python shell. 

More instructions and background are available in the README file (linked below). If you are interested 
in downloading and playing the game, it is additionally linked below. If you are unfamiliar with Deal or 
No Deal, I provide an explanation of how to play in the README file.
