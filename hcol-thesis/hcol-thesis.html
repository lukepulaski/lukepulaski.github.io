        <p class="content-text">
          This study investigates the impact of foreign immigration on rental rates and owneroccupied house prices in metropolitan areas in the United States. Using a panel dataset that covers 381 American metropolitan areas from 2013 to 2022, I demonstrate that immigration may have a significantly positive short-term effect on housing prices. After implementing a version of the classic shift-share instrument to control for the endogeneity of immigration and housing costs, I find that a 1% increase in immigrant concentration as a proportion of total metropolitan area population leads to about a 2% increase in rental rates and a 3% increase in house prices. However, when I decompose the total effect of immigration on housing costs into the effect solely due to increases in immigrant demand and the effect due to induced native migration, I discover that only 18.4% of the total effect on housing costs can be attributed to direct demand from immigrant inflow. Lastly, I find that the impact of immigration on house prices is significantly higher at the upper end of the house price distribution.

        <h2 class="section-header">Introduction</h2>
        <p class="content-text">
          Immigration has always been a hotly debated topic in American political circles, though it
has emerged as a particularly divisive issue as the 21st century has progressed. The debate
surrounding immigration policy is not unfounded; the U.S. has historically been a prime destination
for immigrants from all corners of the globe. In more recent times, these immigration trends have
not shown any signs of slowing down. In 2025, about 53.3 million immigrants are estimated to live
in the United States, comprising about 16% of the country’s population (Carmotta & Zeigler, 2025).
More importantly, immigrant inflows have been quite substantial, as since 2009, the immigrant
population in the United States grew by about 16 million, which would equate to about a 43%
increase in the country’s total immigrant stock. This growth is far from insignificant: for example,
immigration is estimated to account for more than 80% of the overall U.S. population growth in
2024 (Congressional Budget Office, 2024). Clearly, immigration is a primary driver of demographic
changes in the United States. It is also a pivotal factor dictating changes in economic trends.
        </p>
        <p class="content-text">
          The economic outcomes most often linked to immigration pertain to the labor market. In
both the academic literature and the political discourse surrounding the effects on immigration in
the U.S., much effort has been dedicated to showing the impacts of immigration on labor market
outcomes such as the wage rate and employment of native-born workers. However, the impact of
immigrants on other sectors of the U.S. economy is largely overlooked. One of those sectors that
has only recently surged to the forefront of the immigration literature is the housing market.
        </p>
        <p class="content-text">
          The state of the housing market has always been considered a key barometer of the
economic health of almost any developed nation, and the U.S. is no different in that regard. The
housing market represents another domain in which immigrants potentially compete with nativeborn individuals; much concern has been expressed that immigration drives up housing costs and displaces incumbent native-born residents. Indeed, housing costs are rising in a manner similar to
the American immigrant stock: since 2011, the median monthly rate for a rental unit in the United
States has increased almost 19%, while the median value of an owner-occupied home has grown by
about 44% (Fabina, 2024). Given that the growth in immigrant population in the U.S. during the
2010s and into the 2020s has mirrored the growth in housing costs, there is reason to believe that
there may be a causal link between the two.
        </p>
        <p class="content-text">
          This paper provides evidence that, in the short term, immigration may, in fact, lead to higher
rents and house prices. To accomplish this, I utilize a panel of 381 metropolitan areas in the United
States over the period from 2013 to 2022. The fact that immigrant inflows may be endogenous to
rental rates and house prices poses an issue of reverse causality that I attempt to resolve through the
use of a shift-share instrument. This strategy essentially entails using past immigrant settlement
patterns to predict future inflows. Using this instrumental variable technique, I estimate that
immigration has a significantly positive short-term effect on both rental rates and house prices. My
results indicate that an increase in immigrant inflow equal to 1% of a metropolitan area’s population
equates to around a 2% in rental rates and a 3% increase in house prices. This type of an effect,
which has been observed throughout the relevant literature, suggests that immigrants do not
displace natives through competition for vacant housing. In fact, not only do my findings insinuate
that native displacement is not occurring, through my decomposition of the total demand effect of
immigration on the housing market into the effects from direct demand of immigrants and induced
demand caused by native migration, I find that substantial native inflow is expected to accompany
immigrant inflow. Because of this, I estimate that only 18.4% of the total demand effect of
immigration on rental rates and house prices is actually due to immigration. Finally, I suspect that
immigration may not have the same effect in areas where house prices are rising as it does in areas
where they are falling or not growing quickly. I find that, while there is no statistically significant difference between the effects of immigration on the lower and upper ends of the rent distribution,
immigration has a more profound effect on the upper end of the house price distribution.
        </p>
        <p class="content-text">
          This study makes several important contributions to the economic literature surrounding the
effect of immigration on the housing market. First of all, most papers that concern the effect of
immigration on the housing market in the United States are quite limited in terms of geographical
scope, with a number of such studies analyzing only one region or city, such as New York City
(Finney, 2024) or Miami (Card, 1990; Saiz 2003). Saiz (2007) and Partridge, et. al. (2009) do estimate
the effects of immigration on rental rates and house prices in the U.S. on a national scale, but
outside of these studies, there is little recent empirical work on this particular matter. Additionally,
this paper seeks to establish a causal link between immigration inflows and housing cost dynamics
by controlling for potential economic drivers of migration, such as income, unemployment, and
education, as well as the historical settlement patterns of immigrants. By accounting for these
factors, I can more realistically argue that any change in rental rates or house prices that I observe
are caused by immigration, as opposed to housing costs being the reason for immigration. This
study also decomposes the total effect of immigration on housing costs into the sum of the direct
demand effect of immigrants and the induced demand effects from population shifts caused by
immigration. While the mobility of native-born individuals has been described by many authors as a
potential confounding factor in estimating the effect of immigration on housing costs, only recently
has that effect actually begun to be quantified within the literature. While Sanchis-Guarner (2023)
and Unal, et. al. (2024) employ such a technique to investigate the direct demand effect of
immigration on house prices, in Spain and Germany, respectively, this paper is one of the few
existing studies to attempt to estimate the direct effect of immigration on both rental rates and
house prices in the United States. Finally, this study adds to a limited body of literature that
quantifies how immigration affects the lower and higher ends of the rent and house prices distributions. As with the decomposition of the total effect of immigration, only a handful of studies
empirically test for the heterogeneity of the effect of immigration on housing costs. While the
analyses conducted in that regard by Saiz (2003), Braakmann (2019), and Unal, et. al. (2024) either
do not concern the United States or are quite narrow in scope, I investigate how the effect of
immigration on housing costs varies across the nationwide housing cost distribution.
        </p>
        <p class="content-text">
          The structure of the remainder of the paper is as follows: Section 2 reviews the relevant
literature concerning the effect of immigration on housing costs. Section 3 describes my data
sources and explain the restrictions on the study period. Section 4 provides an overview of the
patterns in immigration and housing cost dynamics across American metropolitan areas throughout
my sample period. Section 5 discusses each of my identification techniques: my main empirical
model, instrumental variable construction, and decomposition of the total effect into partial effects.
Section 6 displays the results of implementing each of these empirical strategies. In Section 7, I run
several robustness checks, and Section 8 concludes.

      <section id="lit_review" class="section">
        <h2 class="section-header"> Literature Review </h2>
        <p class="content-text">
          Until fairly recently, the theoretical and empirical literature exploring the impact of
immigration on native-born individuals’ economic well-being has been centered around how
immigration affects labor market indicators for native workers, namely wages and employment rates.
Borjas (1994) and Friedberg & Hunt (1995) have found the effects of immigration on native
economic outcomes to be largely inconsequential in their own analyses of the themes commonly
observed in the literature concerning the economics of immigration to the U.S. However, the effects
of immigration on the labor market outcomes of native-born workers can vary drastically depending on factors such location, era, skill levels of native workers and immigrants, among others (Edo, 2019).
        </p>
        <p class="content-text">
          Since then, interest has grown in investigating the effect of immigration on other aspects of
the receiving economy outside of the labor market. An early analysis of the impacts of immigration
on another such sector – the housing market – can be seen with case study of the effects of the 1980
Mariel boatlift, which saw tens of thousands of Cuban defectors flock to the Miami, Florida
metropolitan area. What makes an event such as the Mariel boatlift such an appealing medium for
the study of the economic effects of immigration is the fact that, in this instance, migrants are, more
or less, randomly assigned to a destination location. When estimating the effect of immigration on
an economic outcome, such as rental rates, in a certain area, it is often true that immigrants are
attracted to areas that have more favorable economic conditions, which would include lower rental
rates. Given this, any estimation of the effect of immigration on rental rates would suffer from selfselection bias because it would be capturing some of the effect that the rents have on the decision to
immigrate to an area. This issue, better known as “endogeneity”, is mitigated in a study of the effect
of immigration using the Mariel boatlift, in which the destination of the immigrants is predetermined
(because the Mariel immigrants had no say in where they settled, selection bias is essentially
eliminated). 
        </p>
        <p class="content-text">
          By replicating Card’s (1990) experimental design but using the price of rental housing units
as the outcome variable, Saiz (2003) takes advantage of the “natural experiment” presented by the
Mariel boatlift. He finds that the boatlift increased the Miami area’s renter population by 9% over a
2-year span. This growth in the renter population led to the growth rate of rental prices rising 8
percentage points during that same time frame, suggesting that the Miami area’s rental housing
market experienced negative short-run effects due to the immigration shock. Additionally, a few similar studies have been conducted to assess the impact of other exogenous shocks, or sudden
waves of migrants, on the demand for and the price of rental housing. For example, the inflow of
Syrian refugees in southeastern Turkey was found to have raised the rental rate of the average
apartment by about 5.5% (Tumen, 2016). The effect of such influxes seemed to lessen as the scope
of the region became larger, as was the case with Venezuelan migrants into Colombia’s most
populated metro areas (Forero-Vargas & Iturra, 2022). While the Mariel study and related
experiments offer insights as to why the housing markets of certain areas might react negatively to
immigration, not many like them exist in the body of immigration literature. This is because
relatively few migration events exist in recent history where immigrants are randomly assigned to
destination locations.
        </p>
        <p class="content-text">
          The more common type of study tends to look for the effect of a consistent flow of
immigration on rental rates and the prices of owner-occupied homes over a span of several years, as
this is how larger developed nations normally experience immigrant inflows. In such studies,
immigrants settle in many different parts of the destination region at different times, meaning that
endogeneity becomes an issue once again. To combat this, these studies implement one or more
instrumental variables (IV), a technique that involves adding a variable to the main empirical model
of a study that explains why immigrants might choose to settle in certain areas. This variable should
be correlated with immigration to a destination location yet correlated with housing market
outcomes such as rental rates or house prices only via its effect on immigrant inflows. The inclusion
of an instrumental variable essentially introduces the random assignment of immigrants to
destination locations. In the aforementioned body of literature, two types of IV strategies arise: the
usage of immigration rates from a prior year (a “past immigration” instrument), and the “shiftshare” instrument.
        </p>
        <p class="content-text">
          In theory, areas that have received many immigrants in a past year will also receive large
numbers of immigrants in the present, thereby making immigration in a previous year a functional
instrument as it explains in a current year while being uncorrelated with rental rates or house prices.
Some studies have made use of past immigration, often in a year before the beginning of the time
period of the panel in question, as an instrumental variable. One example can be seen in Partridge,
et. al.’s (2009) panel of all U.S. metropolitan counties (counties that are classified to be part of a
metropolitan statistical area, or MSA) from 2000 to 2005. They instrument their immigration
variable with the 1970 share of each county’s population that was foreign-born, as well as the 1980
share of each county’s foreign-born population. Using this strategy, it was found that a 1% increase
in immigrant concentration decreased rental rates in metropolitan U.S. counties by 0.23%. While this
type of IV approach is semi-adequate, it fails to capture the nuances of why an immigrant might
elect to settle in a certain location.
        </p>
        <p class="content-text">
          The shift-share instrument, the most common IV technique in the modern literature on the
effects of immigration on the housing market, better addresses the nuances in immigrants’ choices
of destination. Bartel (1989) notes that, not only do immigrants, particularly immigrants to the U.S.,
tend to settle in areas where immigrant presence is strong, but they tend to opt for areas where large
numbers of immigrants from their country of origin have settled. This phenomenon, later termed
“enclave effects” (Borjas, 2002), is based on the idea that a network of other linguistically and
culturally similar immigrants is a significant factor in an immigrant’s choice of location. The shiftshare instrument takes advantage of enclave effects to create a version of the “past immigration”
instrument that should be more correlated with current immigration. In the implementation of this
IV approach, a base year, often the first year of a time frame of a panel, is chosen. For each
geographical unit of interest, the proportion of the total immigrant inflow that came from each
country of origin is calculated. For all subsequent years and geographical units, immigrant inflow from each country of origin is predicted using the proportions calculated for the base year. To
calculate the shift-share instrument, the predicted figures are summed up and given as a proportion
of the total population for each geographical unit. Immigration predicted by the calculations of the
shift-share variable should still be correlated with real-life immigration, and it has the added benefit
of explaining more of the subtleties of immigrant settlement patterns than “past immigration”
instruments.
        </p>
        <p class="content-text">
          Even among studies that utilize some form of a shift-share instrument in their experimental
designs, there does not seem to be a consensus on the true effect of immigration on the housing
market. Saiz (2007) finds that, with a sample of the 306 American metropolitan areas classified as
“metropolitan statistical areas” (MSAs) in 1983, a 1% increase in the inflow of immigrants as a
proportion of the MSA population led to a 0.96% increase in rental rates the following year, as well
as almost a 3% increase in home prices. A 1% increase in immigrant inflow equated to about a 3%
increase for a panel of 50 Spanish provinces from 2001-2012 (Sanchis-Guarner, 2023), and a near
7% increase in Switzerland from 1998 to 2016 (Helfer, et. al., 2023). The effect of immigration on
house prices varies more in terms of both direction and magnitude, with a 1% increase in immigrant
concentration having impacts ranging from slight reductions in house prices in a sample of 170
regions in England and Wales (Sá, 2015), to virtually zero change in an analysis of 20 cities in Italy
(Accetturo, et. al., 2014), to more noticeable increases, such as 4% increases in the value of owneroccupied homes in the United States (Saiz, 2007) and Switzerland (Helfer, et. al., 2015).
        </p>
        <p class="content-text">
          When analyzing the effect of immigration on housing market outcomes, Lewis and Peri
(2015) remind us that immigrants are not the only agents of population change in a geographic
area—the mobility of native-born population is a pivotal factor to consider. In the immigrationlabor market literature, this is an oft-repeated point. Edo (2019) notes that, with regards to the labor market, native workers should, theoretically, react differently to immigration shocks depending on
the skill level of the immigrant workers. If the immigrant workers share a similar skill level with the
native labor force in a particular destination location, they are more likely to compete with natives
for employment. If it is the case that natives and immigrants are substitutes, we should see
outmigration of native-born individuals. On the other hand, natives and immigrants may be
complementary if they are of different skill levels. In this case, we would maybe expect to see an
influx of native-born individuals into immigrant destination locations. Therefore, the effect of
immigration on the labor market depends quite heavily on the qualities of the immigrants
themselves.
        </p>
        <p class="content-text">
          The same logic has been applied to qualifying the effect of immigration on the housing
market. The magnitude and direction of this impact could hinge on the housing preferences of
immigrants, which in turn could depend on the immigrants’ skill level in that it dictates their income.
The exact degree to which natives move in response to immigrant inflows varies: some studies find
strong evidence of native outmigration (Sá, 2015), some find little to no evidence of native flight
(Card, 2001), and others find strong evidence of the native population increasing as a result of
immigration (Wozniak & Murray, 2012). While many studies acknowledge that the mobility of
native-born individuals as a confounding factor in the search for the true effect of immigration on
rental rates or house prices, very few formally attempt to reconcile it. Sanchis-Guarner (2023), in her
analysis of the effect of immigration on house prices in Spain, decomposes the “total” immigration
effect on house prices into the “partial” demand effect (from increase in population due to the
arrival of new immigrants) and the “induced” demand effect (from additional changes from the
relocation of native-born individuals spurred by immigration inflow). She finds that the partial
demand effect estimates are 24% lower than those of the total effect, suggesting that native inflows
were complementing immigrant inflows in destination provinces. This approach, while replicated in studies such as Unal, et. al.’s (2024) analysis of the effect of immigration on the German housing
market, is still in its nascency and relatively untested in the economic literature.
        </p>
        <p class="content-text">
          Lastly, similar to the effect of native migration, in studies with large, developed nations as
destination countries, the heterogeneity of the effect of immigration on rental rates and house prices
is often discussed in the empirical literature yet seldom quantified. In an analysis of immigration and
property prices in England and Wales, Braakmann (2019) finds that, while property prices below the
median are unaffected by immigration, there is a pronounced negative effect toward the lower end
of the distribution. Unal, et. al. (2024) also find that the effect of immigration on house prices is
minimal that the upper end and much higher (though imprecisely estimated) at the lower end. They
also find similar patterns occurring with flat (apartment) prices and flat rents, though the effects at
the lower end of the distribution, this time, are significant. Overall, the differences between the
effects of immigration on housing markets where rents and prices are falling (or otherwise growing
slowly) and those where rents and prices are growing rapidly is not fully understood; once again, it
seems to depend on the characteristics and housing preferences of immigrants.

          Ultimately, the goal of this study is to apply all of the aforementioned experimental
techniques to the interaction between immigration and rental rates and house prices in the modern
United States, something that has yet to be addressed in the literature. Throughout my discussion of
the results, I will refer back to these studies and compare the effects found in the literature to those
that I have observed in American metropolitan areas from 2013 to 2022. That said, before
implementing any of these techniques, I give a brief overview of the data I will utilize to do so
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="data" class="section">
        <h2 class="section-header"> Data Description </h2>
        <p class="content-text">
          To test the effect of immigration on the American housing market, I employ a detailed panel
of 381 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) observed annually over a time period from 2013 to
2022, making my main unit observation an MSA-year
        </p>
        <p class="content-text">
          Several factors contribute to my choice of both geographical units as well as my study
period. Much of my data in this study is sourced from the United States Census Bureau (USCB) or
sources that utilize USCB data in order to standardize the definitions of MSAs across datasets. All
American MSAs, which consist of a group of counties centered around one or more central cities,
are defined by United States Office of Management and Budget (OMB) every 10 years. More
specifically, 3 years after each decennial census, OMB publishes updated MSA definitions to better
reflect population changes between censes. Of course, not all MSAs are redefined after every single
census, but if an MSA experiences significant population shifts during that time, OMB may add or
remove counties from that MSA after the next census. This would essentially mean statistics from
MSAs that are redefined after a certain census are not directly comparable to those from nominally
identical MSAs a decade prior. For this reason, I begin my period of observation in 2013, when
OMB would have first implemented their updated MSA definitions following the 2010 Census. My
final year of observation is 2022, as OMB released updated MSA definitions to reflect the 2020
Census in 2023. From 2013 to 2022, USCB offers data on 384 MSAs as defined by OMB, 3 of
which I drop due to insufficient years of data, leaving me with a final panel of 381 MSAs. 
        </p>
        <p class="content-text">
          The sources data for several variables this study are the USCB American Community Survey
(ACS) 5-year estimates tables. 5-year estimates are defined as such: for a given year, the 5-year
estimate of a given metric is the weighted average of that metric for a certain location for that year
and the previous four years (United States Census Bureau, 2020). For example, the 5-year estimate of a certain metric in the year 2019 would be calculated by taking the weighted average of annual
estimates from 2015 to 2019. Using 5-year estimates can be quite advantageous in my case, especially
for relatively less populous MSAs, as they give much more precise measurements and are better
suited to map changes in demographic and economic characteristics over time (United States Census
Bureau, 2020).
        </p>
        <p class="content-text">
          My primary sources of immigration data are the ACS Selected Social Characteristics Tables,
which provide 5-years estimates of the foreign-born population that entered the U.S. after 2010 at
the MSA level. Therefore, raw immigrant inflows can be measured as the year-to-year change in the
foreign-born population that entered the U.S. after 2010. One of the challenges presented in the
literature is choosing a proxy for immigration that only captures “new” immigration, i.e. immigrants
that recently arrived in the destination country, ideally less than a year prior to observation. Few, if
any, data sources exist that meet all of the following criteria: 1) they include a broad set of
destination MSAs, 2) they account for both legal and undocumented immigrant inflows (both of
which can affect demographic and economic trends in the U.S.), and 3) they display annual
immigrant inflows for all years in my study period. My preferred measure satisfies the first two
criteria but might not fully reflect new immigrant inflows on an annual basis. Foreign-born
individuals who have entered the U.S. after 2010 may have lived in some other place or places in the
U.S. first before settling in the MSA in which they were observed. While this is almost certainly the
case for a minority of immigrants under my definition, there is no reason to believe that it will
significantly muddy my measurement of immigrant inflows. Immigrants, once they reach their
destination country, may be very immobile, often choosing to remain in or around the area they first
lived when they arrived (Borjas, 1994). If this assumption were to hold true, changes in the foreignborn population that entered the U.S. after 2010 in each MSA would accurately reflect changes in
the immigrant population. Additionally, this series of tables provides data on the total population of each MSA, as well as the number of native-born individuals living in each MSA every year, which I
use to calculate native-born as well as total population shifts.

        <p class="content-text">
          I also obtain data on other economic factors that might be correlated with changes in
immigrant concentration as well as my housing market outcomes. Data on unemployment rates are
obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), and data on income was obtained from the
Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). Data on the educational attainment of MSA populations was
sourced from the ACS Educational Attainment Tables series. I additionally obtain data on the
industrial makeup (what percentage of the workforce is employed in certain sectors) of MSAs from
the ACS Selected Economic Characteristics Tables. For a detailed table showing each variable, its
definition, and its exact source, see Table 1.

          Table 2 displays some descriptive statistics of all MSA-years in the sample. For all variables
included in this study, especially immigrant inflow, there is noticeable variation. On average, MSAs
in this sample experienced changes in immigrant inflow that were slightly less than 1% of their total
population, though more than a few MSAs saw 0 or negative changes, while others saw years with
growth in their immigrant populations equal to about 10% of their total population. In a similar
manner, changes in rental rates and house prices varied drastically over MSA-years. On average,
rents increased annually by a little less than 1% while house prices increased annually about 1.8%.
Once again, some MSAs saw their housing costs declining in some years, while others saw aboveaverage growth. All this is to say that there is plenty of variation in both immigration and housing
cost changes to exploit in the upcoming experiment.

        <p class="content-text">
          As expected with a country where population change varies greatly by geography,
immigration dynamics vary substantially across the United States. Figure 1(a) displays the cumulative
change in the immigrant stock in 381 metropolitan areas from 2013 to 2022 as a proportion of its
2022 population. This metric can be interpreted as the percent change in immigrant concentration
from 2013 to 2022. Changes in immigrant concentration during this span ranged from a high of
about 11% in the Miami area to a low of virtually 0 in the Bay City (Michigan) area. Perhaps
unsurprisingly, the locations that saw the largest increases in immigrant concentration over the
decade in question include some of America’s most populous and prominent metropolitan areas:
Los Angeles, New York City, Houston, Dallas, San Jose, Boston, Washington D.C., Seattle, and
Atlanta, to name a few. On a less granular scale, it seems that immigrant concentration is increasing
the fastest in metropolitan areas in California, Florida, Texas, and various cities in New England and
the Mid-Atlantic.

          During this time, many metropolitan areas across the U.S. also saw substantial growth in
housing costs, though to varying degrees in different locations. Many of the areas that experienced
relatively large increases in rental rates and house prices from 2013 to 2022 also happen to be areas
that experienced noteworthy increases in immigrant concentration. According to Figure 1(b), which
displays the cumulative change in the inflation-adjusted median contract rent for a rental unit,
metropolitan areas such as Atlanta, Orlando, and Nashville saw a large increase in rents; they also
happen to have had large increases in immigrant concentration. A similar trend can be seen with
changes in house prices. Figure 1(c) shows the cumulative change in the inflation-adjusted median
value of an owner-occupied house. This suggests that metropolitan areas like Los Angeles, Seattle, and San Jose, which also saw large increases in immigrant concentration, experienced significant
growth in house prices. 
        </p>
        <p class="content-text">
          Overall, metropolitan areas that experienced growth in immigrant concentration from 2013-
2022 also tended to experience increases in both rental rates and home values. Additionally, many
metro areas with little change in immigrant concentration also saw rental rates and home values
stagnate or even decline. For most metropolitan areas in the country, there seems to be an
association between immigration and housing market outcomes. Indeed, Table 3 tells us that there is
a slightly positive correlation between immigration and rents (correlation coefficient of 0.24) and
house prices (0.15). While the strength of these associations may seem quite weak, it must be noted
that many other economic factors must be accounted for when determining if there is actually a
causal link.

        <h2 class="section-header"> Methodology </h2>
        <h3 class="subsection-header"> OLS Specification </h3>
        <p class="content-text">
          Following Saiz (2007) and much of the economic literature, I utilize Equation 1 to estimate the impact of immigration on rental rates and house prices using ordinary least squares (OLS):
        </p>
        <img src="figures/eq_1.png" alt="Equation 1" class="inline-image">
        <p class="content-text">
          The dependent variable is the change in the log of the real median rental rate/house price in MSA i
in year t. Taking the natural logarithm of the outcome variable allows for simpler interpretation of
the effect of immigration on rents and house prices; the coefficients on the main explanatory
variable can be read as a percent change. First-differencing the outcome variable helps mitigate the
effect of area-specific, time-invariant on immigrant inflow (Saiz, 2007; Sá, 2015; Unal, 2024). The
main independent variable can be read as the lagged immigrant inflow as a proportion of double-
lagged total population in MSA i. Adjusting immigration inflows for the total population stock helps
account for the variation in immigrant inflows across MSAs of different population and housing
market sizes (Sanchis-Guarner, 2023; Unal, 2024).
        </p>
        <p class="content-text">
          ∆𝑋𝑖,𝑡−1 stands for lagged changes in the log of real per capita income, while 𝑊 𝑖,𝑡−1 stands
for lagged unemployment rate, education level of the workforce. These three factors are proxies for
the economic performance of an MSA (Saiz, 2007); it is worthwhile to control for such covariates
because immigrants may be attracted to areas where the economy is performing better. MSAs with
higher rates of income growth, lower unemployment, and a more educated workforce tend to be
viewed as more economically robust, so there is a very real possibility that immigrants are more
inclined to move to areas such as these. Additionally, following Sanchis-Guarner (2023), I control
for the viability of industries that historically employ many immigrant laborers. In my model, I
include the lagged proportion of the workforce employed in the agricultural sector, construction
sector, or manufacturing sector. The logic behind this decision is that, depending on their skill level,
immigrants may be drawn to MSAs where many of the jobs are provided by industries that are most
likely to offer them ample employment opportunities.
        </p>
        <p class="content-text">
          Lastly, 𝛾𝑖 represents MSA fixed effects (FE) and 𝜆𝑡 represents year FE. Implementing MSA
FE will capture the effect of any time-invariant MSA characteristics that could be correlated with changes in rental rates, house prices, or immigrant inflows. In a similar manner, the usage of year FE
will control for nationwide economic shocks, such as recessions or inflationary periods, that affect
immigration to all MSAs in the sample as well as the economic performance of those areas.
        </p>
        <h3 class="subsection-header"> IV Specification </h3>
        <p class="content-text">
          Without an exogenous immigration shock, it is difficult to estimate a causal effect of
immigration on housing market outcomes because immigrant inflow may be endogenous to both
rental rates and house prices. That is to say, immigrants do not randomly distribute themselves
across metropolitan areas. They may be attracted to areas where housing costs are decreasing or
rising more slowly (which would result in downward bias of the estimated effect), or they may be
attracted to areas with rising housing costs because they believe that these price increases are
reflective of growing employment opportunities in the area (Sa, 2015). Regardless of the direction of
the bias created by the endogeneity issue, we require an instrument that meets two criteria. It must
be relevant (it should explain, or be correlated with, the settlement patterns of immigrants) and valid
(it should be correlated with either housing market outcome only by way of its effect on immigrant
inflows). The aforementioned shift-share instrument, the most common instrumental variable in the
related literature, should satisfy both of these criteria. It is usually structured as follows:
        </p>
         <img src="figures/eq_2.png" alt="Equation 2" class="inline-image">
        <p class="content-text">
          ∆ 𝑖𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑡𝑠𝑘,𝑡 is the predicted number of new immigrants in MSA k in year t,  𝑗,𝑘,2013 is the
share of immigrants from country j that settled in MSA k in the base year, 2013., and
∆ 𝑖𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑡𝑠𝑗,𝑈𝑆,𝑡 is the predicted number of total number of immigrants from country j that settled in the US in year t. Immigrant inflows are expressed as a proportion of prior MSA
population.
        </p>
        <p class="content-text">
          Before testing the aptitude of this instrument, I must make some modifications to its
structure. Unfortunately, the data available to me does not allow me to implement the traditional
origin-country-based shift-share instrument. With the ACS dataset I used to derive immigrant
inflows, the origin countries of individuals born outside the U.S. that entered the U.S. after 2010 are
not published for many MSAs. For relatively less populous metropolitan areas that receive relatively
fewer immigrants, it is challenging for the U.S. Census Bureau to accurately estimate the inflow of
foreign-born persons who entered the U.S. after 2010 from countries that send very fewer
immigrants to the U.S. Thus, for all 381 MSAs in my dataset, there is no way to obtain the number
of individuals who meet my criteria for being counted as an “immigrant” from origin countries that
send very few individuals to the U.S.
        </p>
        <p class="content-text">
          Saiz (2007) does present a feasible alternative: the U.S.-level shift-share instrument. He
structures it as such:
        </p>
        <img src="figures/eq_3.png" alt="Equation 3" class="inline-image">
        <p class="content-text">
          ∆ 𝑖𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑡𝑠𝑘,𝑡
̂
is the predicted number of new immigrants in MSA k in year t,  𝑘,2013 is the
share of the total immigrants that moved to MSA k in the base year of 2013, and
∆ 𝑖𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑡𝑠𝑈𝑆,𝑡
̂
is the predicted total number of new immigrants who settled in the U.S. in year
t. Similarly to the origin-country based instrument, immigrant inflows are expressed as a proportion
of prior MSA population.
        </p>
        <p class="content-text">
          Saiz (2007) is able to predict the annual total number of new immigrants to the U.S. as a
whole using a random effects regression model that uses the presence of economic and political
hardships like wars, depressions, and instability in origin countries to calculate the probability that an
immigrant will migrate to the United States. Lamentably, many of the data sources he uses to
construct this model either no longer exist or contain no data for the period from 2013 to 2022. So,
I will use the actual total number of new immigrants who settled in the U.S. in year t instead, yielding
the final instrument specification:
        </p>
        <img src="figures/eq_4.png" alt="Equation 4" class="inline-image">
        <p class="content-text">
          The U.S.-level instrument still uses base-year immigrant inflows to predict inflows in subsequent
years; the only real difference is the fact that all immigrants to the U.S. in a given year, regardless of
their country of origin, are treated the same in terms of their probability of settling in a certain MSA.
So, this IV approach does unfortunately disregard the network effects that have been deemed to be
pivotal in an immigrant’s decision of where to settle. However, I will demonstrate that the modified
instrument is still an excellent predictor of actual immigrant inflows, and that it is correlated with
housing market outcomes only through its correlation with actual immigrant inflows.
        </p>
        <p class="content-text">
          Table 5 displays the first-stage regression results, which is designed to show if there is a
strong relationship between the instrument and the main independent variable (immigration). The
coefficient on the instrument is positive and significant at the 1% level, meaning my U.S.-level
instrument is in fact heavily correlated with immigrant inflows. Furthermore, a first-stage F-test of
this coefficient yields a test statistic of 11.86, which exceeds the threshold of 10 set by Stock & Yogo
(2005). The results of this F-test again indicate that is more likely than not that the immigrant
inflows predicted by the U.S.-level instrument is correlated with actual immigration. Given this evidence, I can confidently say that the U.S.-level instrument, in my case, is relevant. Validity, on the
other hand, is difficult to statistically ascertain. A reduced-form regression might help in showing
that the instrument is correlated with the outcome variables (rent and house prices). Indeed, the
results in Table 6 demonstrate that the U.S.-level instrument is heavily associated with rent and
house prices. Ascertaining if the correlation between predicted immigration and housing market
indicators occurs only through actual immigrant inflows is somewhat challenging. Saiz (2007) does
note that the events occurring in immigrants’ countries of origin that cause them to migrate, such as
military conflicts, economic turmoil, or political instability, are very likely to be unrelated to rental
rate and house price dynamics in the United States. Therefore, it is reasonable enough to assume
that immigration rates predicted by the U.S.-level instrument are only linked to housing market
outcomes by way of actual immigration to the U.S.

        <p class="content-text">
          Many studies acknowledge that the movement of native-born individuals as a result of a
wave of immigration could be a confounding factor in estimating the true effect of immigration on
housing cost changes. Despite this, Sanchis-Guarner (2023) authored one of the first papers that
formally derived the direct effect of immigration on house prices. Following Sanchis-Guarner
(2023), I estimate the following equations:
        </p>
        <img src="figures/eq_5_7.png" alt="Equations 5-7" class="inline-image">
        <p class="content-text">
          Equation 5 is exactly the same as Equation 1 in the “OLS Specification” subsection; it
estimates the total impact of immigration on housing market outcomes. Equation 6 measures the
partial immigrant demand and Equation 7 measures the impact of immigration on native mobility.
The following relationship between the coefficients on the main explanatory variables in all three
equations can then be established:
        </p>
        <img src="figures/eq_8.png" alt="Equation 8" class="inline-image">
        <p class="content-text">
          What the decomposition implies is as follows (assuming all coefficients have been
consistently estimated): the total effect of lagged immigrant inflow relative to double-lagged total
MSA population can be decomposed into the sum of the partial effect that immigrant inflows have
on housing market outcomes and the partial effects that immigrant inflows have on housing market
outcomes via its impact on native migration. This can be rearranged to say that the total effect is
equal to the partial effect of immigrant inflows times 1 plus the effect of immigrant inflow on native
migration.
        </p>
        <p class="content-text">
          Intuitively, if  3 = 0, immigrant inflows must not be causing any inflow or outflow of native-
born individuals, so the changes in housing market outcomes caused by immigrant inflows would
solely be a product of changes in housing demand driven by immigrants. If  3 < 0, this would
indicate that natives are moving out of the regions where immigrants are settling. In that case, our
previous estimates of the total effect understate the direct effect of immigrant inflows on housing
market outcomes. If  3 > 0, this would indicate that natives are moving into of the regions where
immigrants are settling. In that case, our previous estimates of the total effect overstate the direct
effect of immigrant inflows on housing market outcomes.

          All coefficients in this specification are instrumented using the U.S.-level instrument. In her
formal decomposition, Sanchis-Guarner (2023) slightly modifies her shift-share instruments to
predict total MSA population as well as changes in the immigrant population in order to better
account for the decisions of native-born individuals to migrate to certain areas. I do not implement
this strategy because, with my data, it would create a weak (not relevant) instrument.

          At this point in the analysis, I have only described the construction of conditional mean
regressions. That is, these specifications will have predicted the average value of the change in rental
rates/house prices conditional on a certain change in immigrant concentration. However, some
concern has been expressed in the literature that the effect of immigration on housing costs varies
between the lower and higher ends of the rental rate/house price distribution (Braakmann, 2019;
Unal 2024). In particular, because immigrants to the United States have been found to consume less
housing per capita than their native-born counterparts and tend to demand less expensive housing
(Greulich, et. al., 2004; Finney, 2024), it is worth considering whether the effect of immigration on
housing costs is stronger on the lower end of the distribution.

          To accomplish this, I construct a series of quantile regressions, all of which are instrumented
using the U.S.-level instrument. I estimate the effect of immigration on housing market outcomes at
the 5th percentile, 25th percentile (first quartile), 50th percentile (median), 75th percentile (third
quartile), and 95th percentile of the rental rate/house price distribution.
