# University of Vermont (UVM) Honors College Thesis

On April 25, 2025, I successfully defended this thesis to earn the distinction of Patrick Leahy Honors 
College Scholar at UVM. Researched and written over the course of about 1 and a half academic years, this 
project was undertaken with the guidance of my advisor, Professor Rich Sicotte, and several other professors 
with the UVM Department of Economics.

Much of the research gathered for this paper was conducted through databases such as JSTOR and ScienceDirect.
I additionally read and analyzed individual papers recommended to me by my professors. The data for this project, 
most of which came from various United States Census Bureau datasets, was cleaned in MS Excel and Stata, as
was new variable construction and generation. All regressions were run in Stata as well.

ABSTRACT: This study investigates the impact of foreign immigration on rental rates and owner-
occupied house prices in metropolitan areas in the United States. Using a panel dataset that covers
381 American metropolitan areas from 2013 to 2022, I demonstrate that immigration may have a
significantly positive short-term effect on housing prices. After implementing a version of the classic
shift-share instrument to control for the endogeneity of immigration and housing costs, I find that a
1% increase in immigrant concentration as a proportion of total metropolitan area population leads
to about a 2% increase in rental rates and a 3% increase in house prices. However, when I
decompose the total effect of immigration on housing costs into the effect solely due to increases in
immigrant demand and the effect due to induced native migration, I discover that only 18.4% of the
total effect on housing costs can be attributed to direct demand from immigrant inflow. Lastly, I
find that the impact of immigration on house prices is significantly higher at the upper end of the
house price distribution.
