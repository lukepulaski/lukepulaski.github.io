# About Me

Thank you for visiting my page! My name is Luke Pulaski, and I am a 2025 graduate of the University of Vermont
with a Bachelor of Science in Economics. I am currently seeking an entry-level position in roles similar to a 
data analyst or consultant. My primary industries of interest are health economics/health policy, labor economics, 
energy policy, antitrust, and environmental economics, though at this point in my career I am very open to branching 
out into a different field.

This page serves both as a sample of projects I completed as a UVM student (highlighted by the Honors Thesis I finished as a 
senior) and as a repository for additional projects that are of personal interest to me. Please feel free to explore my 
work below.

If you are interested in connecting, I would love to get in touch with you! I've linked my email, LinkedIn, and GitHub below, 
as well as copies of my rÃ©sumÃ© and official UVM transcript.<br>

# Personal Projects

This section consists of additional work I am doing on my own time. Through these projects, I will mostly 
explore topics that interest me through a lens of statistical analysis. 

I hope to display my ability to formulate and understand a niche problem, analyze relevant data to propose answers, 
and present my findings in an engaging manner. I also hope that these pieces will demonstrate my competency 
in platforms like Microsoft Excel, Python, and R, and my overall skills in research, data cleaning, data anlysis, 
and written communication.

As these projects progress, I will do my best to provides general updates on the status of each one. 

If you have any suggestions concerning my ongoing or completed projects or have ideas for small-scale data analyses 
that you would like to see, please do not hesistate to reach out to me! 

I hope you enjoy!
