# Undergraduate Work

For each project, I have done my best to include all pertitent files and information. However, all
the necessary files for some of these projects may not be included, and there is a chance that some of 
the Stata files I have included are incorrect. I had a Stata license through UVM while I was a student 
there, but my license has since expired. While all my project files are saved to my MS OneDrive, I cannot 
verify the contents of each file. If you have a Stata license and notice that I have posted any incorrect 
data files or malfunctioning Stata code, please [email me](mailto:luke.pulaski@gmail.com) or [message me through LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luke-pulaski-437656200/) and, if possible, 
I attempt to fix it. Also feel free to reach out to me if you have any other clarifying questions about any 
of these projects.
