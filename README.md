# About Me

# Undergraduate Work

For each project, I have done my best to include all pertitent files and information. However, all
the necessary files for some of these projects may not be included, and there is a chance that some of 
the Stata files I have included are incorrect. I had a Stata license through UVM while I was a student 
there, but my license has since expired. While all my project files are saved to my MS OneDrive, I cannot 
verify the contents of each file. If you have a Stata license and notice that I have posted any incorrect 
data files or malfunctioning Stata code, please [email me](mailto:luke.pulaski@gmail.com) or [message me through LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luke-pulaski-437656200/) and, if possible, 
I attempt to fix it. Also, feel free to reach out to me if you have any other clarifying questions about any 
of these projects.

# Personal Projects

This section consists of additional work I am doing on my own time. Through these projects, I will mostly 
explore topics that interest me such as baseball, music, and my favorite TV shows through a lens of statistical 
analysis. Though most of these projects probably won't be very "economic" in nature, some of my research 
ideas are more akin to traditional economic research questions. 

I hope to display my ability to formulate and understand a niche problem, analyze relevant data to propose answers, 
and present my findings in an engaging manner. I also hope that these pieces will demonstrate my competency 
in platforms like Microsoft Excel, Python, and R, and my overall skills in research, data cleaning, data anlysis, 
and written communication.

I envision the final drafts of these projects to be written in the style of blog posts (an overall objective and 
informative tone with little bits of my subjective opinions and informal language) while maintaining the basic 
structure of a research paper.

As these projects progress, I will do my best to provides general updates on the status of each one. 

If you have any suggestions concerning my ongoing or completed projects or have ideas for small-scale data analyses 
that you would like to see, please do not hesistate to contact me! I can be reached via [email](mailto:luke.pulaski@gmail.com) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luke-pulaski-437656200/). 

I hope you enjoy!
