# Undergraduate Work

I have done my best to make all components of each of these projects (code, datasets, research proposals, etc.)
accessible. Unfortunately, given that several of these projects were conducted in platforms like Stata (which I only 
had access to while I was actively a UVM student), there may be some components missing. If there is a file or dataset 
that you would like to see, email me or message me through LinkedIn and I will try to find it for you.
