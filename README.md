# About Me

Thank you for visiting my page! My name is Luke Pulaski, and I am a 2025 graduate of the University of Vermont
with a Bachelor of Science in Economics. I am currently seeking an entry-level position in roles similar to a 
data analyst or consultant. My primary industries of interest are health economics/health policy, labor economics, 
energy policy, antitrust, and environmental economics, though at this point in my career I am very open to branching 
out into a different field.

This page serves both as a sample of projects I completed as a UVM student (highlighted by the Honors Thesis I finished as a 
senior) and as a repository for additional projects that are of personal interest to me. Please feel free to explore my 
work below.

If you are interested in connecting, I would love to get in touch with you! I've linked my email, LinkedIn, and GitHub below, 
as well as copies of my rÃ©sumÃ© and official UVM transcript.<br>

# Undergraduate Work

This section highlights a few of the papers, coding projects, and other work from my time as an undergraduate at UVM. If you are interested
in learning more about some of my undergrad projects, I would highly recommend checking out my Undergraduate Research Assistantship work as 
well as the work pertaining to my Honors College thesis. I've additionally posted a term paper from my Health Economics course as well as some 
older projects from computer programming courses I took as an underclassman.

The highlights of my undergradute coursework at UVM included:
- ECON 3500: Econometrics & Applications
- ECON 4200: Economics of Regulation
- ECON 4500: Advanced Economic Analysis
- ECON 4700: Advanced Industrial Organization
- ECON 4850: Health Economics
- ECON 4996: Honors Thesis
- CS 021: Computer Programming I (Python)
- CS 110: Intermediate Programming (Java)

For each project, I have done my best to include all pertitent files and information. However, all
the necessary files for some of these projects may not be included, and there is a chance that some of 
the Stata files I have included are incorrect. I had a Stata license through UVM while I was a student 
there, but my license has since expired. While all my project files are saved to my MS OneDrive, I cannot 
verify the contents of each file. If you have a Stata license and notice that I have posted any incorrect 
data files or malfunctioning Stata code, please [email me](mailto:luke.pulaski@gmail.com) or [message me through LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luke-pulaski-437656200/) and, if possible, 
I attempt to fix it. Also, feel free to reach out to me if you have any other clarifying questions about any 
of these projects.

# Personal Projects

This section consists of additional work I am doing on my own time. Through these projects, I will mostly 
explore topics that interest me such as baseball, music, and my favorite TV shows through a lens of statistical 
analysis. Though most of these projects probably won't be very "economic" in nature, some of my research 
ideas are more akin to traditional economic research questions. 

I hope to display my ability to formulate and understand a niche problem, analyze relevant data to propose answers, 
and present my findings in an engaging manner. I also hope that these pieces will demonstrate my competency 
in platforms like Microsoft Excel, Python, and R, and my overall skills in research, data cleaning, data anlysis, 
and written communication.

I envision the final drafts of these projects to be written in the style of blog posts (an overall objective and 
informative tone with little bits of my subjective opinions and informal language) while maintaining the basic 
structure of a research paper.

As these projects progress, I will do my best to provides general updates on the status of each one. 

If you have any suggestions concerning my ongoing or completed projects or have ideas for small-scale data analyses 
that you would like to see, please do not hesistate to contact me! I can be reached via [email](mailto:luke.pulaski@gmail.com) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luke-pulaski-437656200/). 

I hope you enjoy!
