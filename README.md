# About Me

Thank you for visiting my page! My name is Luke Pulaski, and I am a 2025 graduate of the University of Vermont
with a Bachelor of Science in Economics. I am currently seeking an entry-level position in roles similar to a 
data analyst or research assistant. My primary industries of interest are health economics/health policy, labor economics, 
energy policy, antitrust, and environmental economics, though at this point in my career I am very open to branching 
out into a different field.

This page serves both as a sample of projects I completed as a UVM student (highlighted by the Honors Thesis I finished as a 
senior) and as a repository for additional projects that I have been doing on my own time. Please feel free to explore my 
work below.

If you are interested in connecting, I would love to get in touch with you! I've linked my email, LinkedIn, and GitHub below, 
as well as copies of my rÃ©sumÃ© and official UVM transcript.<br>
