# Voting Data Analysis - Tristan Smith's Campaign for Lynn School Committee

## Overview

Since September of 2025, I have been contributing to [Tristan Smith's campaign for a seat on the school committee](https://www.smithforlynn.com/) of Lynn, Massachusetts, a mid-size city north of Boston and adjacent to my hometown of Swampscott. Although plenty of volunteeers have generously showed up to canvass and hold signs on roadside islands, his campaign 

## Background

I first met Tristan Smith in 2015 as a 7th grader at Swampscott Middle School, where he was working as a substitute teacher and coaching track and field while taking pursuing a degree at nearby Salem State 
University. 

While I never personally had him as a sub for any of my classes, I'll never forget going to the bathroom in the middle of class and passing by a room where he was 
subbing and immediately feeling a level of positive energy that should not be emanating from a room full of tweens that want nothing more than for the bell to ring 
and for last-period English class to finally be over. His exuberance, endless patience, and ability to relate to each and every one of his students earned him 
widespread adoration among my classmates. I also remember that he was one of the main reasons why I decided to join the track team despite having the athletic 
ability of a tranquilized turtle wearing ankle weights. He proved to be an excellent coach, exhibiting the same passion he brought every day in the classroom. 
Under his guidance, I not only came to enjoy competing in the hurdles, high jump, and shot put, but actually improved enough at those events to qualify to compete 
at the all-conference meet the next year. His belief in me (and all of my classmates) and his mission to help us grow as both students and athletes still resonates 
with me to this day.

Many yeras later, when I got word that Mr. Smith had [announced his candidacy for State Representative of Massachusetts' 8th Essex district](https://lynnjournal.com/2022/05/25/tristan-smith-campaign-kickoff-for-state-representative/) 
in May of 2022, I knew I had to help lend him a hand in any way I could. So, after getting off work each afternoon, I would canvass the district's voters, knocking on doors and 
phone banking to gauge interest in Mr. Smith's candidacy and to field questions about his stances on issues such as healthcare, education, environmental policy, and how to allocate the state budget surplus. 
Throughout the summer, Mr. Smith, who, at the time, was fresh out of law school with no experience holding public office, ran an extremely effective campaign that vaulted him from being regarded as a relative 
underdog to actually being given a real shot at securing the Democratic nomination. Despite widespread criticism regarding his inexperience, Mr. Smith's platform clearly resonated with voters. 
While Mr. Smith ultimately [fell just short of Jenny Armini](https://ballotpedia.org/Tristan_Smith) in the Democratic primary, I am extremely proud of him for the campaign he ran and for never wavering from 
what he believed in.

All of these experiences motivated me to reach back out to Mr. Smith when I learned of his candidacy for a seat on the Lynn School Committee. 

## My Role

Because the election is still ongoing, I am unfortunately not at liberty to publish the results of the work I have conducted for Mr. Smith's campaign. I will post all data files (raw and cleaned), data extraction and cleaning programs, and finalized reports after the polls close at 8 PM on November 4, 2025.
