# University of Vermont (UVM) CS 110 Final Project

I completed this project for my Intermediate Programming class in the spring semester of 2023, which was conducted entirely 
in Java.

The prompt was quite simple: the entire class was required to build the game Yahtzee in Java. 

More instructions and background are available in the README file (linked below). If you are interested 
in downloading and playing the game, it is additionally linked below. I hope you enjoy it!
