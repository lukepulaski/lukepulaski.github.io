Thank you for your interest in my CS 110 Final Project!

The entire class was assigned the task of building Yahtzee that is playable in the Java shell.

If you are interested in playing, open and run the file 'GameDriver.java'.

If you have never played Yahtzee before, that's okay. I hadn't either until constructing this project.
After submitting the project I got hooked on Yahtzee for the rest of the semester and it became my 
primary time waster over YouTube and Clash Royale. I will never forgive Hasbro for this. 

Anyway, if you don't know how to play, I've linked the official instructions below:

I hope you enjoy!
